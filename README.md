## Design
The website has been created for clear and easy to use separation of information. The pages have been linked with a simple navigation menu, which adapts to a range of devices for ease of use. 














## Deployment
Using Github 

### My Repository

1. Created a new public local repository on my Github account, and copied the repository to Gitpod to start building the website.

2. When writing my code using Vscode, I ensured I committed my changes to my local repository in regular intervals, using clear messaging for any changes I had made. 
      - git add .
      - git commit -m "This would be my message on what I had changed"

3. After making my regular commits, I would then push the commits to my remote repository by using the command 'git push'. 

### Hosting 

1. To host my website, I went to Github and selected my repository named Mindfulness Kids Club.
2. I went to Settings > Pages 
3. I made sure the following settings were applied:
      - Source: 'Deploy from a branch' on the dropdown menu
      - Branch: 'Main' and 'root' from the dropdown menus
      - Pressed save
4. This takes a few minutes to deploy, and will be found on the righthand-side of the repository dashboard page.
